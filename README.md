Short Answer

1. 

   'Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today', is a requirement literally (not            figuratively) impossible. Early milestones that cemented what the internet means to people today include: 


   1980: ENQUIRE software
   The European Organization for Nuclear Research (better known as CERN). Created a hypertext program allowing scientists to    keep track of people, software, and projects.

   1984: DNS (Domain Name Servers) invented 
   DNS allows Internet users an easy to remember name for your domain which is then converted into the IP address.

   1988: First major malicious internet-based attack
   “The Morris Worm”, it was written by Robert Tappan Morris and caused major interruptions across large parts of the          Internet.

   1989: Proposal for the World Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee. 

   1990: World Wide Web protocols finished, by Tim Berners-Lee.
      - included the standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs.

   1991: The first web page created.

   1995: Commercialization of the internet
   
   1995: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 
   An encryption developed by Netscape, making it safer to conduct financial transactions (like credit card payments)          online.

   1996: Java and JavaScript 

   1998: Google went live

The internet consists of billions of interconnected devices and networks, made possible by the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). These devices have the ability to perform different actions. Retrieving, sending, and traversing information across the World Wide Web requires multiple components a browser, web servers, DNS, and so much more to perform important tasks. Using a combination of softwares, languages, protocols, security and encryption a community, known as the internet formed. Creating industries and allowing business' to scale to new highs with online presence, new tech and opportunities.

Blockchain technology, a 'scam' or the technology that will power the next generation of internet, aka web3 or the decentralised web. It's important to know that the internet we know today is currently CENTRALIZED. In layman's terms centralization represents, a couple people holding all the cards (all the power, similar to an oligopoly). Together, effectively controlling the internet (I'm looking at you FAANG). These companies own our information and control what sources and information we consume on a daily basis. If I were reading this, i'd already be concerned about my personal information and my limited choices to information... 

What if I told you 'there is nothing you can do about it'? 
What if I told you 'they profit off you and you don't receive compensation'?
What if I told you 'blockchain is for the people, individuals and you'?

What if I told you 'Currently top 3 payment transaction average @ $6billion/day, facebook will have a coin in 2020, microsoft has adopted'... would you take this opportunity?
